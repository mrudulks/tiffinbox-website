      "What a wonderful surprise.<br />I’ve stayed at the Ramada Coventry on numerous occasions and have always thought about having a meal in The Tiffin Box but due to work commitments I’ve been unable to. On my last visit I brought along my girlfriend so made a great effort to get over this time. I’m so pleased that I did. The restaurant is great. The murals that have been painted on the walls are so colourful and it’s nice to hear tradition Indian music (all be it with a modern sound) in the background.<br />The food was so tasty such a great blend of spices used, not to overpowering in my opinion just the right amount of flavour coming through.<br />The staff were all extremely friendly, the young waitress was very efficient but with enough emphasis on the customer and not clearing as you eat. The bar manager took great time and pleasure showing myself and girlfriend around the restaurant and explaining the murals and the plans for the restaurant.<br /><br />In conclusion I would highly recommend The Tiffin Box, I will be making it a regular eating place when ever I’m in Coventry, the only disappointment is there’s not one near my own home.<br />I only have one photo of a dessert that the manager was kind enough to treat us to ( it was so good), next time I visit I’ll be taking pictures of the murals.<br />To all the staff I’d like to thank them for the great service, friendly attitude and the time that they spent explaining things to us. Keep up the good work.",

      "I recently dined at tiffin box and had an exceptional experience. The food was absolutely delicious, with each dish bursting with authentic Indian flavors. The chicken mapps was creamy and rich, while the poratta were perfectly crispy and delicious . Every bite was a true culinary delight.<br><br>The atmosphere was equally impressive. The restaurant had a warm and inviting ambiance, with tasteful decor that beautifully blended traditional Indian elements with a modern touch. It was the perfect setting for a relaxed and enjoyable meal.The service was top-notch. The staff were incredibly attentive and friendly, ensuring that we were well taken care of throughout our visit especially the chef ( Chef jomon ) . They were knowledgeable about the menu and offered great recommendations. Our orders were promptly served, and the team went above and beyond to make our dining experience memorable.<br><br>Overall, Tiffin box is a gem. If you’re looking for outstanding Indian cuisine, a welcoming atmosphere, and impeccable service, this is the place to go. Highly recommend!",

      "First time at The Tiffin Box and the very first thing that we noticed was the excellent service! The staff were so helpful and super fast with getting everything sorted. We really felt looked after! Then the food - absolutely delicious. Can't wait to eat here again especially the porotta. We all had the Chicken in various curries! Just all round fresh and tasty ingredients.  Would recommend - will be back again next year!",

      "I went to the tiffin box with my family all the way from Wirral and I will never regret driving down to the place, we have tried banana fritters with beef, palkappa with fish, thekkumkoor beef fry beef biriyani and kallappam, I should say the quality of food they offer is the best you can get, we are 101% satisfied with the Quality, quantity and price of the food. I must say about the service, it's outstanding ❤️❤️<br><br>Parking: Parking opposite at Ramadas parking",
